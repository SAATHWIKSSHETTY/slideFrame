2. **Select the Latest Release**  
   Find the version labeled as the most recent. Click on it to view the assets.

3. **Download the Files**  
   Look for the assets section. Download the `slideFrame.js` and `slideFrame.css` files. You will use these files in your project.

## 👩‍💻 How to Use slideFrame

1. **Add the Files to Your Project**  
   Place the downloaded `slideFrame.js` and `slideFrame.css` in your website's directory.

2. **Link the CSS and JS Files**  
   In your HTML file, link to the CSS and JavaScript files. Add the following lines within the `<head>` section for CSS and before the closing `</body>` tag for JS:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/slideFrame.css">
   <script src="path/to/slideFrame.js"></script>
   ```

   Replace `path/to/` with the location where you saved the files.

3. **Implement the Overlay**  
   To create the overlay, add the following HTML where you want the link to appear:

   ```html
   <a href="https://your-external-link.com" class="overlay-link">Open Link</a>
   ```

   Change the `href` attribute to the link you want to display.

## 🎨 Customize the Styles

You can customize the styles of the overlay by modifying the `slideFrame.css` file. Here are a few properties you can change:

- Background color
- Font style
- Size of the overlay

Change these styles to fit your website’s design.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
